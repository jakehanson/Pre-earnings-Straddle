# Pre-earnings straddle
The goal of this directory is to indescriminantly test a pre-earnings staddle. We will be testing the strategy over the last six years (01/01/12 - 01/01/18) on the composite DOW 30 + NASDAQ 100. The choice of the backtesting window and index are due in part to generality and in part to testing [claims made by CMLviz](https://vimeo.com/255317960) about this data set. We find that a pre-earnings straddle is in fact a winning strategy over this time period with average returns of +2% per straddle. The backtest results for different fixed bets and distribution of returns are shown below. Full analysis [here](https://jakerhanson.weebly.com/blog/do-pre-earnings-straddles-work).
