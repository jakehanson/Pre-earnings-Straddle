# Pre-earnings straddle
The goal of this directory is to indescriminantly test a pre-earnings staddle. We will be testing the strategy over the last six years (01/01/12 - 01/01/18) on the composite DOW 30 + NASDAQ 100. The choice of the backtesting window and index are due in part to generality and in part to testing claims made by CMLviz about this data set. We find that a pre-earnings straddle is in fact a winning strategy over this time period with average returns of +2% per straddle. The backtest results for different fixed bets and distribution of returns are shown below.
